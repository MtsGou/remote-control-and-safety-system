Codes containing development of remotely controlled robot and systems prototypes for autonomous vehicles technology, including emergency and security intelligence.

The Autonomous Emergency and Monitoring System (SEMA) is responsible for managing the actions to be taken in emergency situations, caused by general, hardware or software failures. The system consists of an electronic board with embedded application, using microcontrollers STM32L476RG from ST Microelectronics, whose processor is the ARM model 32-bit Cortex® M4, and ESP32, widely used in IoT applications, whose processor is the 32-bit Xtensa® Dual-Core LX6.

Under normal circumstances, this system takes no action andworks passively, without influencing navigation or navigation in any way.

SEMA is active in situations that it deems to be emergent, in terms of hardware and software, or if there is direct order from the CPU or the controller. SEMA has output pins whose signals are transmitted directly to the truck's electronic control units, the ECMs, exercising the
drive-by-wire function. SEMA signals are responsible for acting only in emergency cases, sending the necessary information to the brakes (emergency and delay) and to the accelerator, so that the truck brakes appropriately. The activation is done by relays, which, in normal position, select the UPA signals for the drive-by-wire outputs. When it becomes active, SEMA switches the relays, selecting for the outputs the signals generated by the SEMA microcontrollers or, in other cases, by oscillators (circuit integrated NE555).

Codes were written in the C and C++ languages, according to the
ANSI C/C++ (American National Standards Institute) standard. Additionally, the page

front-end of SEMA, saved in flash with the name “index_html”, was written using
HTML, CSS and JavaScript language. The STM32L4 microcontroller firmware
was written in C language, using hardware abstraction layer (HAL),
in the STM32Cube IDE. The ESP32 firmware was written in C++ on the platform
Espressif PlatformIO.
